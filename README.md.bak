# STUNT GP RELOADED
Hobbist remaster of Team17's 2001 game Stunt GP on Unity engine. Uses modified [Randomation Vehicle Physics](https://github.com/JustInvoke/Randomation-Vehicle-Physics) as base physics model. The target of this project is to not only recreate this classic game with high quality textures, but also to implement track editor and online multiplayer.
